I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL)](https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/) at Queen’s University, conducting research in Software Engineering and mentoring students under the supervision of Dr. [Ahmed Hassan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hwXx34AAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Bram Adams](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XS9QH_UAAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining Queen’s University, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Alberta in 2024 under the supervision of Dr. [Cor-Paul Bezemer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8HgcKdoAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on:

- Software Package Ecosystems
- SE for AI
- AI for SE
