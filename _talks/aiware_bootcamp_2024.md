This session explores how Foundation Models (FMs) are being integrated into Software Engineering (SE) practices and how SE practices are adapting to the development and deployment of FMs based on an analysis of industry blogs. Topics covered include:

- Leveraging an FM/LLM Jury to automatically survey grey literature such as industry blog posts
- Industry insights from 1,152 blog posts—showcasing real-world applications of integrating FMs and SE
- FMs for SE (FM4SE) activities—software development, software quality assurance, software maintenance, and software management
- SE for FMs (SE4FM) activities—model deployment, system architecture, data management, model customization, evaluation & quality assurance, and prompt construction
- Eight research directions to bridge the gap between academic research and industry practices
